ECE 327: Digital Hardware Systems
- 3A ECE course that goes over the basics of design and modelling of digital hardware systems using an HDL (offered in Verilog)
- Analyzed digital hardware systems at the RTL using state machines, data patr abstractions, and memory abstractions
- Completed 4 deliverables that covered combinational and sequential logic, state machines, memory systems, and functional testing using a testbench
